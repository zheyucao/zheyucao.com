A full-stack Student Management System developed for a university database course assignment (DBLabs).

Key aspects include:

- Comprehensive database design (PostgreSQL) based on requirement analysis, ensuring data integrity via constraints.
- Python backend using Flask and SQLAlchemy (ORM) providing RESTful APIs for CRUD operations.
- React frontend (TypeScript) for a responsive user interface, interacting with the backend API.
