---

An operating system pilot course project focused on core kernel concepts through independently completed labs.

Key kernel development labs included:
- **Bootloader & Initialization:** Developed the bootloader and managed system startup sequences in assembly.
- **Memory Management:** Implemented virtual memory using paging mechanisms.
- **Process Scheduling:** Designed and implemented a basic process scheduler.
- **System Calls:** Managed kernel-user space interaction through system call handling.

Additionally, co-developed the graphics system (2-person team):
- Led system design, driver implementation, and the composition layer.
- Implemented features like antialiasing, dirty region detection, alpha blending, etc.
- Designed and built a foundational window manager and GUI toolkit.
