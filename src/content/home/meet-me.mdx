I'm Zheyu Cao, a fourth-year undergraduate in **Computer Science and Technology** at **Northwestern Polytechnical University**.

I enjoy tackling challenges and creating cool projects, from websites to handcrafted OS kernels. I currently focus on **Artificial Intelligence**, particularly exploring the capabilities of LLMs.

Currently, I am eager to contribute to cutting-edge Deep Learning research.
