I'm Zheyu Cao, a fourth-year undergraduate student at Northwestern Polytechnical University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology.

I'm deeply interested in frontend development, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. I love exploring and learning cool new things, especially where technology meets aesthetics.
